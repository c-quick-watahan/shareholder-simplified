# File Processing Automation Proposal

## Problem Statement

File uploads and lottery processing require manual intervention through the proposed web dashboard. This creates bottlenecks, introduces human error, and **diverts development resources from shareholder-facing features** to internal tooling maintenance.

## Proposed Solution

Implement an automated file processing system using a Raspberry Pi deployed on the office network that:

1. **Monitors networked folders** using Python's [watchdog](https://pypi.org/project/watchdog/) library
2. **Processes files immediately** upon detection (lottery runs, data validation, etc.)
3. **Uploads to cloud infrastructure** (GCS storage, Cloud SQL database)
4. **Archives processed files** to maintain audit trail
5. **Runs continuously** without human intervention

## Technical Architecture

- **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi 4 (~$75) connected to office network
- **Software**: Python service with watchdog file monitoring
- **Startup behavior**: Process any accumulated files, then enter continuous monitoring mode
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive logging and retry logic
- **Maintenance**: Remote SSH access for monitoring and updates

## Business Benefits

### Operational Efficiency

- Eliminates manual file upload steps
- Reduces processing delays from hours/days to seconds
- Prevents human error in file handling

### Development Resource Allocation

- Frees engineering time from internal tooling maintenance
- Allows focus on shareholder-facing features and revenue-generating functionality
- Reduces technical debt in dashboard code

### System Reliability

- Almost constant processing capability
- Consistent handling regardless of staff availability
- Automated audit trail and error reporting

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

- **Initial cost**: ~$100 (hardware + setup time)
- **Ongoing cost**: Minimal (5W power consumption)
- **Developer time saved**: Significant time and money savings vs adding multiple web portals
- **Risk reduction**: Eliminates upload errors and processing delays

## Conclusion

This automation directly supports our core business objective: **maximizing shareholder value by eliminating non-essential internal processes.**
